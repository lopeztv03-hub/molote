    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The materials on the TikTok Bot are provided on an 'as is' basis. The Service makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>

    <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
    <p>In no event shall the Service or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the Service, even if we or a representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>

    <h2>5. Accuracy of Materials</h2>
    <p>The materials appearing on the TikTok Bot could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

The Service may make changes to the materials contained on the Service at any time without notice.</p>

    <h2>6. Links</h2>
    <p>The Service has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by the Service of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
